<h3>News</h3>
<p>
<b>2009-06-20</b><br/>
The sources are now in Bazaar. As you can see, I've been using Bazaar from the beginning but the Savannah support wasn't there. I recently found out that it was available so I pushed it in. Check it out <a href="http://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/lh/ballandpaddle">here</a>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>2008-09-30</b><br/>
Finally, after more than a month, version 0.8.0 is released!
This version has a new script system using GNU Guile.  
Almost everything can be scripted. Fonts used, skins, graphics for almost anything, which powerups are used, are more! 
</p>

<p>
<b>2008-08-26</b><br/>
Website finally up! Version 0.7.1 has been released and version 0.8.0 will be released very soon with new graphics/levelsets and a completely new extension system using GNU Guile. 
</p>


<h3>Introduction to Ball and Paddle</h3>

<p>
Ball and Paddle is an extensible ball and paddle game that lets you script the events and attributes of the objects (balls, blocks, powerups, etc.) with GNU Guile, the official GNU extension language.

<h3>Development</h3>
<p>
Ball and Paddle uses Bazaar for version control. Get it by
</p>

<pre class="emph-box">bzr branch http://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/r/ballandpaddle/trunk</pre>

<p>
or you can <a href="http://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/lh/ballandpaddle">browse</a> the sources. 
</p>

<p>It requires SDL, SDL_image, SDL_mixer, SDL_ttf, and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile">GNU guile</a>. 
</p>

<p>
We currently need more and complete level sets for the game to be really fun. 
Also, I'd be willing to look into a level format that doesn't require guile (so that an editor could be made) but uses guile in the backend i.e. the level format refers back to guile code/functions.
